# BOM files & Gerber changelog


Updated the gerber to v1.1. No drastic changes for anyone that has v1.0 already. Removed the 10k resistors from the controls, after extensive testing it wasn't required (they were added incase the PCAL's internal pull ups were not enough for a large board) Tidied up some routing and also angled the UART port slightly to allow a 90 degree pinheader. Will keep the BOM for v1.0 for now.
